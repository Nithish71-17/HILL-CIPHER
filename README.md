IMPLEMENTATION OF HILL CIPHER
 
## To write a C program to implement the hill cipher substitution techniques.

## DESCRIPTION:

Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B
= 1... Z = 25, is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters is  multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To
decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the m trix used for
 
encryption. The matrix used
 
for encryption is the cipher key, and it sho
 
ld be chosen
 
randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).


## ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text and key from the user. STEP-2: Split the plain text into groups of length three. STEP-3: Arrange the keyword in a 3*3 matrix.
STEP-4: Multiply the two matrices to obtain the cipher text of length three.
STEP-5: Combine all these groups to get the complete cipher text.
